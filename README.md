This iOS app is titled Movie App. When a user opens the app, they're presented with a screen that will allow them to search for a movie with key words. The search result will display the poster images of those films on a screen where the user can then scroll through the search results. When a poster image is tapped, it will bring up a detailed view which displays information about the film. As you can see on the above images the sequences show you the process of how to  get the related movie information from the search.
